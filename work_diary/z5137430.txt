Week 1
I wrote some simple python files to test the API of Finnhub and Tinngo. 
The test file would print the company name and last price of APPL and AMZN to the console.
I pushed the files to my own git and shared it to my teammates. 
I also restructured the project specification, make it point-form and in a more easy-to-read manner.

Week 2
I drafted the user stories and ER diagram together with my team, then I drafted the use case diagram with Stephon.
During the meeting, I created a progression check table to ensure that our team can finsih the proposal on time. 
At the end of the week 2 I drafted the process flow chart.

I finished the proposal together with groups. Following is my works:
  - Rewrite and improve background section
  - Transfer US and epics from google doc to proposal

Week 4
I completed user stories about the watchlist with the help of Jeffrey and Stephon.

Week 5
I helped to refactor all files of the project by adding comments and using pylints. I finished reflection 1 together with my team. Following is my reflection:
  - Construct a time schedule of all members so that we can decide the date and time of next meeting easier and earlier.
  - Suggest members to add comments to their codes to improve readibility

Week 6 & 7
I completed the user stories about showing information of owned stock. 
I refractored my old codes about watchlist, and make a new file called formatter.py.
This file takes in different inputs and export a string of HTML tags. 

Week 8
Keep working on the statistic reports. Now stocks are grouped by currency, so that later on the P/L can be calcuated based on currency.
Format and improve the appearance of the report.

Week 9
Final refinement of codes before working on project:
  - Min. Amt of buy/sell >= $1
  - Bank balance implemented (Both UI & Backend)
  - Refractor user.routes.py. Codes related to Buy / Sell are moved to the folder "order"
  - Refractor the folder "ownList". Now the entire balance sheet is encapsulated in OOP style.
  - Make Reset Account button to reset balance sheet
  - Did several Debugs
