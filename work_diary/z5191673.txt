Week 1

Group formed. I created the Jira & Github accounts, together with all the other teammates,
I have drawn up the draft of the user story of the proposal. I have also discussed with my team about the libraries and APIs that can be useful for the project.
I have set up the github classroom repo, now the virtual environment and auto Python style checking tools are in-place.
We have planned to finish off the ER diagram and class diagram by next week.

Week 2

I finished up the Class Diagram with The Tran and the Use Case Diagram with Luna.
I completed the ER diagram after gathering advices from all the teammates. Our team also improved the USs further,
by spliting up large USs into smaller USs and changed a few acceptance criteria of certain USs.
The progress of the project goes well, we will be wrapping up all the things required in the proposal next week.

Week 3

Our team and I have rechecked all the contents in the proposal, the major obstacle is we need to synchronize all our works,
e.g. make sure the User Stories are in accordance with all of our graphs. All of the members have put a lot of time on that.
We will start our first sprint next week. I wrotee some code to construct our project skeleton, so that other team members can work more smoothly later on.

Week 4
I have setup the the landing page, the overall file structure and the database of the project, teammates can now easily start their work based on these.
The main obstacle was fetching current stock price from online websites, the reason we need to do so is there's no free api providing New Zealand current stock price.
I have spent some times on trying IP rotation and Agent rotation, however, since those IP I used are from public free proxies, they get blocked easily.
To get around this, I realise yahoo finance's robots.txt mentioned that scrapers are allowed to scrap their information, therefore now I use my own IP address to scrape data from yahoo finance.
I have also completed the autocompletion of stock search, user can now type stock names/codes in the search bar and the system will provide recommendations to the user.
