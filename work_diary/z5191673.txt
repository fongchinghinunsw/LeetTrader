Week 1

Group formed. I created the Jira & Github accounts, together with all the other teammates, I have drawn up the draft of the user story of the proposal. I have also discussed with my team about the libraries and APIs that can be useful for the project. I have set up the github classroom repo, now the virtual environment and auto Python style checking tools are in-place.
We have planned to finish off the ER diagram and class diagram by next week.

Week 2

I finished up the Class Diagram with The Tran and the Use Case Diagram with Luna. I completed the ER diagram after gathering advices from all the teammates. Our team also improved the USs further, by spliting up large USs into smaller USs and changed a few acceptance criteria of certain USs. The progress of the project goes well, we will be wrapping up all the things required in the proposal next week.
